# utscFinanceHacks
University of Toronto Scarborough Finance Hackathon Team Repo


A web app that loaded random pairs of companies via Xignite's Exchange API. Users select which company they think is superior based on the metric, ie "Beta, Market Cap, Margins, etc.". Company logos were loaded from a seperate API. 

jQuery and Javascript were used on the clientside to query Xignite and to manipulate the DOM. Boilerplate front end with Google Material Design. 

The purpose of the hackathon was to improve the public's financial literacy.

No longer works since temporary API keys were used to access Xignite API.
